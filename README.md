# COVID and Income in the US

Even though there is an avalanche of COVID-19 data that's available, it's primarily centered on geography (think: "States with the most cases.")  There has been some work on other demographic factors, but I haven't found anything yet that focused specifically on income level.

This is an exercise in examining COVID-19 infection rates by US county based on median household income levels.

**Disclaimer** I am not a data scientist.  I'm just a nerd who was trying to figure out something.  Please comment, fork, update, etc.

All sources are listed in the notebook.  COVID data comes from the New York Times; population and income data from the USDA.
